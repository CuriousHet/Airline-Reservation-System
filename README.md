The Airline Reservation System is a comprehensive software solution designed to streamline and simplify the process of booking and managing airline tickets. This project provides a range of functionalities to enhance the user experience and ensure a smooth booking process.

## Functionalities:

1) **New User Signup**: Users can create their accounts securely by providing necessary information, including a username and password.

2)**User Login**: Registered users can log in using their credentials, ensuring a personalized and secure experience.

3) **Flight Searching**: The system allows users to search for available flights by specifying source and destination. It retrieves flight information from a pre-populated database and displays relevant details such as flight numbers and departure times.

4) **Ticket Booking**: Users can book tickets by selecting a flight from the search results and specifying the date of travel. Multiple tickets can be booked in a single transaction by providing passenger details (name, age, contact number).

5) **Ticket Cancellation**: Ticket cancellations are supported. Users must provide their username and password to validate the cancellation request. This adds an extra layer of security and ensures that only authorized users can cancel their tickets.

6) **Print Booked Tickets**: Users can easily access and print all previously booked tickets from their account. This feature provides a convenient way for travelers to access their ticket information.

## Additional Features:

> **Direct Booking with Flight Number**: Instead of searching by source and destination, users can also book tickets directly by specifying the flight number, making the booking process more efficient.

> **Data Storage**: All ticket-related data is stored in a file, ensuring that important information is not lost and can be retrieved when needed.

> **Security**: The system prioritizes security by requiring users to enter their username and password for various actions, such as booking and canceling tickets, ensuring that only authorized users can access these features.

The Airline Reservation System is designed to provide a user-friendly interface for travelers while offering robust functionality to handle flight booking, ticket management, and user account security. This project aims to make the airline booking process hassle-free, efficient, and reliable for users.
